#me
Hello?
What's going on?
Who are you?
This is {load(adj#ap)}
I want to {load(verb#action)}
That sucks
This is CS 50.

#char
Hey man, it happens
You must look inside
The {load(noun#item,plur)} are in the {load(noun#item)}
Why are you so {reuse(adj,strict)}?
That sucks
You should have {load(verb#vpchar)}!
This is CS 50.
