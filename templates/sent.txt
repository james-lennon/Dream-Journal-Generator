#intro
I saw a {load(adj)} {load(noun#char)} with {load(noun#item,plur)} {enum(coming out of|all over|sticking out of|on)} its {load(noun#body)}
A {load(noun#char)} {enum(appeared|came out of nowhere|showed up)} and {load(verb#vpchar)}

#thought
Perhaps this was because I had a {reuse(noun#item,strict)} on my {enum(desk|table)} in waking life

#loc
I was {load(verb#action,ger)} in a {load(adj)} {load(noun#loc)}, and I {load(verb#vpme)}
My {enum(friends|family|dog)} and I were at a {load(noun#loc)}, but it's a very strange {reuse(noun#loc)} {enum(on top of a {load(noun#loc)}|with {load(noun#item,plur)} everywhere)}
I'm {load(verb#action,ger)} in a {load(noun#loc)} when all of a sudden a {load(noun#char)} {load(verb#vpchar)}

#chngloc
The scene changed to a {load(noun#loc)}, with a {load(noun#char)} {load(adv#vmod)} {load(verb#action,ger)}
I looked around and saw that I was now in a {load(noun#loc)}, and I {load(verb#vpme)}
{enum(I don't know why|I don't know why I thought it would be a good idea|I wanted to stay)}, but I {load(verb#move,past)} to a {load(noun#loc)}
{enum(the details are fuzzy|I don't remember how)}, but I somehow got to a {load(noun#loc)}

#action
The {reuse(noun#char,strict)} began to {load(verb#actionobj)} me, but I {load(verb#vpmeobj)}
The {reuse(noun#char,strict)} {load(adv#vmod)} {load(verb#vpchar)} me
the {reuse(noun#loc,strict)} {enum(strangely|)} {load(verb#vpchar)}
The {reuse(noun#char,strict)} {load(verb#vpchar)}
{enum(I didn't know what to do, so |)}I {load(verb#vpme)} {enum(for some reason|thinking this would help)}
I {enum(was enjoying myself|was very uncomfortable)} because it was {load(adj#ap)} {enum(inside|outside)} the {reuse(noun#loc,strict)}
I was {load(verb#action,ger)} aimlessly
several more {reuse(noun#char,plur,strict)} showed up and started {reuse(verb#action,ger,strict)} too
my {load(noun#body)} started falling off, and I {load(verb#vpme)}

#end
Then, I woke up
The {reuse(noun#char,strict)} {load(verb#action,past)} into {enum(nothingness|thin air|the ground)}
I jolted awake
{load(sent#action)}, and I smiled
The {reuse(noun#char,strict)} continued doing this indefinitely
The last thing I remember is the {reuse(noun#char,strict)} saying "{load(speech#char)}"
As I {load(verb#vpmeobj)}, the dream ends
