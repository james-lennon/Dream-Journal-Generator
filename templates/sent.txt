#intro
I saw a {load(adj)} {load(noun#char)} with {load(noun#item,plur)} {enum(coming out of|all over|sticking out of|on)} its {load(noun#body)}.
I was {load(verb#action,ger)} in a {load(adj)} {load(noun#loc)}, and I {enum(felt)} very {load(adj#emo)}.
A {load(noun#char)} {enum(appeared|came out of nowhere|showed up)}.

#action
The {reuse(noun#char,strict)} began to {load(verb#actionobj)} me, but I {load(verb#vpmeobj)}.
{enum(thinking this was strange,|I began to realize something was amiss, and)} I {load(verb#vpme)}.
The {reuse(noun#loc,strict)} suddenly {load(verb#vpchar)}.
I looked around and saw that I was now in a {load(noun#loc)}, and I {load(verb#vpme)}.
The {reuse(noun#char,strict)} {load(verb#vpchar)}.
I didn't know what to do, so I {load(verb#vpme)} {enum(for some reason|thinking this would help)}.

#end
Then, I woke up.
