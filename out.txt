My friends and I were at a dorm, but it's a very strange dorm on top of a hotel.  I was very uncomfortable because it was very bright inside the dorm.  I was thinking aimlessly.  I looked around and saw that I was now in a bed, and I began to run away.  The bed strangely showed me several bags.  I was very uncomfortable because it was somewhat obscure outside the bed.  I jolted awake.

I saw a red person who looked just like me with phones on its tongue.  The person who looked just like me began to slap me, but I could tell it was getting slightly anxious.  I was shaking aimlessly.  The scene changed to a beach, with a statue slowly running away.  I was very uncomfortable because it was extremely futuristic inside the beach.  A zombie appeared and gave me some insects.  The beach strangely walked to a hotel.  The hotel strangely began to slap me.  The last thing I remember is the statue saying "Hey man, it happens"

I saw a hideous scarecrow with bugs on its back.  I didn't know what to do, so I began to crumble thinking this would help.  I didn't know what to do, so I heard a voice say "You should have began to drive away me!" thinking this would help.  Then, I woke up.

A cat came out of nowhere and began to throw some bumps at me.  The cat said "You must look inside"  Several more cats showed up and started going away too.  The details are fuzzy, but I somehow got to a dining hall.  The cat began to stand on me.  A teacher appeared and showed me several ices.  The teacher gave me some mice.  The teacher began to take a photo of me, but I drove away it and ran away.  The cat began to shoot me, but I tried to get it to grab me, and I smiled.

My dog and I were at a basement of a hotel, but it's a very strange hotel on top of a island.  I didn't know what to do, so I stopped being worried for some reason.  I was enjoying myself because it was very graceful inside the island.  A man showed up and began to shake.  The man started to spit out lots of ices.  I was very uncomfortable because it was somewhat massive outside the basement of a hotel.  The man melted into the ground.

My friends and I were at a classroom, but it's a very strange classroom on top of a bed.  I was running away aimlessly.  I didn't know what to do, so I heard a voice say "You should have ran to a airport!" thinking this would help.  I saw a tiny director of the airport with bugs on its arms.  Several more directors of the airport showed up and started running away too.  The director of the airport began to smack me, but I could tell it was getting very like I had accomplished something satisfying.  The director of the airport continued doing this indefinitely.
