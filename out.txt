I saw a enormous woman with pencils coming out of its face.  The woman quickly began to shrink in height.  I didn't know what to do, so I began to run away which was not very helpful.  I looked around and saw that I was now in a bed, and I said "This is CS 50."  The woman began to walk away from me, but I tried to get it to kick me.  A person who looked just like me appeared and said "You must look inside."  The person who looked just like me began to throw some bugs at me.  I was running away aimlessly.  As I shouted at it "I want to run away.", the dream ends.

A girl appeared and began to shake.  The girl began to kick me, but I screamed at it "This is very futuristic."  The girl began to yell at me.  As I tried to stop it from jumping over me, the dream ends.

I'm melting in a hotel when all of a sudden a scarecrow showed me several cars.  The scarecrow started thinking.  My eyes started falling off, and I began to melt.  I don't know why I thought it would be a good idea, but I went away to a church.  My back started falling off, and I stopped being happy about it.  The scarecrow showed me several pens.  As I shouted at it "Hello?", the dream ends.

A person who looked just like me showed up and walked to a airport.  The person who looked just like me began to sing to me, but I tried to stop it from yelling at me.  I was very uncomfortable because it was somewhat small outside the airport.  As I tried to get it to kick me, the dream ends.

I saw a graceful person who looked just like me with cars coming out of its back.  The person who looked just like me began to melt.  The person who looked just like me started shrinking in height.  I looked around and saw that I was now in a basement of a classroom, and I began to grow much larger.  I was enjoying myself because it was somewhat blue inside the basement of a classroom.  The basement of a classroom strangely began to take a photo of me.  The person who looked just like me continued doing this indefinitely.

I'm melting in a bridge when all of a sudden a person who looked just like me gave me some pencils.  The person who looked just like me began to yell at me, but I could tell it was getting very worried.  Several more people who looked just like me showed up and started melting too.  The scene changed to a bridge, with a boy slowly growing much larger.  The boy wildly started crumbling.  The boy carefully began to yell at me.  The last thing I remember is the boy saying "Hey man, it happens."
