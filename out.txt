I'm shaking in a classroom when all of a sudden a cat gave me some cats.  I didn't know what to do, so I stopped being worried for some reason.  The cat began to take a photo of me.  The scene changed to a hotel, with a cat carefully melting.  The cat began to take a photo of me, but I punched it and ran away.  The cat showed me several pencils.  The cat thought into nothingness.

I saw a pale woman with phones on its face.  I didn't know what to do, so I stopped being scared for some reason.  I was shaking aimlessly.  I didn't know what to do, so I said "I want to drive" for some reason, and I smiled.

I'm thinking in a classroom when all of a sudden a dinosaur started thinking.  I was very uncomfortable because it was somewhat futuristic inside the classroom.  I was shaking aimlessly.  A monster came out of nowhere and went away to a house.  I didn't know what to do, so I began to shrink in height for some reason.  I was very uncomfortable because it was somewhat pale inside the house.  The last thing I remember is the monster saying "You must look inside"

I saw a graceful statue with metals square sticking out of its back.  The statue began to smack me, but I tried to get it to slap me.  I was shrinking in height aimlessly.  Several more statues showed up and started shrinking in height too, and I smiled.

I saw a obscure statue with ices coming out of its tongue.  The statue began to sing to me, but I could tell it was getting a little furious.  The statue started crumbling.  The scene changed to a bridge, with a scarecrow slowly crumbling.  I was very uncomfortable because it was extremely graceful inside the bridge.  I saw a pale monster with fires sticking out of its eyes.  The bridge strangely showed me several cars.  I was shaking aimlessly.  Then, I woke up.

I saw a towering man with pens on its eyes.  Several more men showed up and started thinking too.  The man started running.  I wanted to stay, but I went away to a party.  I was going away aimlessly.  I saw a graceful person who looked just like me with photos coming out of its tongue.  Several more people who looked just like me showed up and started running too.  The person who looked just like me began to take a photo of me, but I went away away it and ran away.  As I punched it and ran away, the dream ends..

A monster came out of nowhere and whispered "The spikes are in the bump"  The monster began to kick me, but I threw some photos at it and ran away.  I didn't know what to do, so I began to crumble for some reason.  I don't know why, but I went away to a island.  The monster began to walk away me, but I tried to get it to stand on me.  A person who looked just like me showed up and started crumbling.  I was walking aimlessly.  The person who looked just like me began to shoot me, but I grabbed it and ran away.  The person who looked just like me shook into the ground.

I was shaking in a tiny beach, and I began to shake.  I was very uncomfortable because it was very blue inside the beach.  I didn't know what to do, so I heard a voice say "Why are you so tiny?" for some reason.  I saw a blue tin man with bugs sticking out of its feet.  The tin man walked to a party.  The beach strangely started crumbling.  The tin man crumbled into the ground.

My friends and I were at a island, but it's a very strange island with mice everywhere.  I was going away aimlessly.  I was thinking aimlessly.  I saw a massive girl with metals square on its face.  I was very uncomfortable because it was somewhat childlike outside the island.  The girl began to throw some fruit at me, but I tried to get it to yell at me.  As I shouted at it "Who are you?", the dream ends..
